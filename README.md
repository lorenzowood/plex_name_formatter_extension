This is an extension for Chrome or Brave browsers that adds Plex-friendly names to search results on IMDB and TVDB.

It is available at the Chrome web store here: [Plex name formatter exension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/plex-name-formatter/lommookhlmmagmicoccpkhiikhgiaaao).

This extension is handy if you use Plex media server and organise your files.

Plex looks for metadata by examining the names of files and folders. It’s helpful if you give your folder the title of the film or TV show, with the year in parentheses, and the code from either IMDB or TVDB in braces.

With this extension installed, if you search on IMDB (https://imdb.com) or TVDB (https://thetvdb.com), a Plex-friendly name will appear below the title of each movie or TV show result. This name has the title, with characters that don’t work in filenames replaced, followed by the year in parentheses (if available), followed by the relevant code in braces.

For example, if the title _Top Gun: Maverick_ appears in the results on IMDB, the extension adds:

`Top Gun -- Maverick (2022) {imdb-tt1745960}`

on TVDB, it adds:

`Top Gun -- Maverick (2022) {tvdb-16721}`

You can copy the Plex-friendly name to the clipboard simply by clicking on it. When you move mouse over the name, you will see the “copy” cursor. When you have clicked, the text `✓ Copied` appears briefly after the name.
